To run project follow these steps:
* run server (can be done by running main form BootApp OR by './gradlew run')
* open scores.html in web browser (JS scripts subscribe for messages)
* go to "localhost:8080", fill in form and send it
* check on client, should have new values updated

*ATTENTION!!* Server does not push its own updated every 5 seconds like it was taking place before!
